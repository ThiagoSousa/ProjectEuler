# Problem 5

## Solution

We can do via a mathematical solution by  calculating the least common multiple between the numbers from 1 to 20.
The result is basically $2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19$

We can also do a coding solution to calculate the lcm via generating the prime factors of each number. There are two 
implemented functions:
* prime_factors: to generate the prime factors for a list
* lcm: to calculate the least common multiple for a set of numbers.
