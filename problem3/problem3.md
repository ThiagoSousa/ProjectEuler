# Problem 3

# Solution:
We divide the target number 600851475143 by each prime, if they evenly divide the number and get the next prime number 
to test. We do this in the increasing order, if 

We have a function to check if a number is prime and a function to get the next prime number.

`is_prime`: Check if a number is prime. The complexity is O(sqrt(n))
`next_prime`: Find the next prime number. The complexity is linear
