# Problem 2

## Solution 1
Solution 1 iterates through the Fibonacci sequence and check which ones are even numbers. 
Fibonacci sequence is generated by: $a_n = a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$

## Solution 2
In Solution 2, we just look through the even numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:
1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144...
We can see that there is an even number within every 2 numbers in the sequence: 2,8,34,144,...
We can then use a calculation only on the even number of fibonacci sequence by: $a_n = 4*a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$.
