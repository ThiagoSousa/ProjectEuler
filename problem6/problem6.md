# Problem 6

## Coding Solution

We just iterate from 1 to 100 and calculate the sum of the squares and the square of the sums. 
Pretty straightforward, O(n) solution.

## Mathematical Solution
We can just calculate the difference between the:
* sum of squares: Sn = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6 
* Square of the sum = Sn = ((a1+an)*n/2)^2
